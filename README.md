# Protoype of an Affective Video Game
This affective game prototype is an interactive game that adapts to the player's psychological state by using an inexpensive Arduino heart rate sensor and facial emotion recognition through a webcam. The game uses the sensor to monitor the player's heart rate, which can indicate the player's level of stress and fear response. The webcam tracks the player's facial expressions, which can indicate their underlying emotional state. The game then uses this information to dynamically adjust the game's difficulty and audio visual properties to better match the player's current state. This allows for a more immersive and personalized gaming experience that can help players stay engaged and motivated.

This project is done as my undergraduate Final Year Project.
